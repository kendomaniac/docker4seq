\title{Function to execute Cutadapt on RNA-Seq reads}
\usage{
cutadapt(
  group = c("sudo", "docker"),
  scratch.folder,
  data.folder,
  adapter.type = c("NEB", "ILLUMINA", "QIAGEN", "LEXOGEN", "DIAGENE", "SEQMATIC", "TRILINK"),
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: \code{"sudo"} or \code{"docker"}, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the scratch folder where docker container will be mounted}

\item{data.folder, }{a character string indicating where fastq files are located}

\item{adapter.type, }{a character string. Seven options are available depending on which miRNA library prep was used: NEB, ILLUMINA, QIAGEN, LEXOGEN, DIAGENE, SEQMATIC, TRILINK}

\item{threads, }{a number indicating the number of cores to be used from the application}
}
\value{
The fastq files of the trimmed sequencing reads
}
\description{
This function executes the docker container  by running CutAdapt algorithm a the input RNA-Seq dataset to remove the sequencing adapters.
